	<td>He is Crisostomo Ibarra's father. He angers Father Dámaso, who accuses him of heresy and sedition for criticizing the corrupt methods used by the Spanish friars. Before his identity is cleared, he passes away in custody. His body is interred at a Catholic cemetery in the city of San Diego, but because he was a heretic, Father Dámaso pays a grave digger to remove them so they might be interred in a Chinese cemetery.</td>
