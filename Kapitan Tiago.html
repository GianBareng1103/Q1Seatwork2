	<td>In that he is a well-off native Filipino, Capitan Tiago is a rarity. Despite the fact that he has little respect for religion, he maintains strong relationships with prominent Catholics and blatantly participates in racial slurs directed at his own people. His main priority is finding a wealthy, powerful guy to marry off his daughter, Mara Clara.</td>
